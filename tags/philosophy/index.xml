      <description>The value of work is related to all the costs and benefits of the work including the externalities. The usefulness of knowledge is based on its relationship with work. My economics knowledge has not been useful because I have never been in a position where my ignorance on the subject would be costly. My ability to obtain useful and valuable knowledge is dependent on my ability to recognize which kinds of knowledge are not useful to me at that point in time.</description>
