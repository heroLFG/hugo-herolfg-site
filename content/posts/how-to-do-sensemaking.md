Sensemaking is a process of learning and teaching.  Learning and teaching requires constant feedback.  As individuals, we need to appreciate feedback from others and we need to be willing to give feedback to others.  We need to create opportunities for others to give us feedback.  And we need to reach out to people who claim to be interested in working towards common goals.

## Receiving Feedback

If you want to receive feedback, make sure people can [contact you](/contact).  I have a discord server and I can assign roles to people which allow them better access to my attention.  People who have done teaching and learning (sensemaking) with me develop a repuation and receive my attention more easily than strangers.  People who do not want to do sensemaking with me receive less of my attention than strangers.

My discord server requires that you have a cell phone number.  I want some barriers to entry into my attention.  If I were popular, I would add more barriers to try and filter out people who are not serious about sensemaking.  I would be interested in trying to do sensemaking with popular people and helping to improve the way they manage their attention.

## Giving Feedback

The best kinds of feedback I have given is always related to working on projects with teams of people who share a common goal.  During my outreach phase, I practiced reaching out to people who claim to share a common goal with me.  I then discovered the people who do and do not deserve my attention.  The result of this process is a filtering of my attention as I intentionally accept and reject the people who do not share my goals.

Attention is our most valuable resource because it is limited.  This process of giving and receiving feedback helps us curate a list of content providers that are worthy or unworthy of our attention.
