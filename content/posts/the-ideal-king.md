On October 12, 2023 I decided to start practicing making Jesus my king.

I had previously defined a Christian this way.
> A Christian is a person who attempts to be like Christ: a king of kings.
[reference](https://herolfg.com/posts/truth/#christian-people)

The most salient points about Jesus for me now.
1. Love God with all your heart, mind, and soul.
2. Love your neighbor as yourself.
3. Love everyone up to and including your enemies.
4. The mission of King Jesus is to invite the lost sheep into his Father's Kingdom.
5. It is the transformed lost sheep who are lifted high to glorify God.
6. The good vision of peace on Earth and the Kingdom on Earth as in Heaven can't be done any other way.
7. Confess your weaknesses to the Father and to your [friends](https://herolfg.com/posts/truth/#friends)

And so my definition of what it means to be a Christian has changed.  A Christian is someone who practices submitting to Jesus as their King who is God's beloved and God's ideal re-presentation.
