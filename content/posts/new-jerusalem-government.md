As we move towards an increasingly interconnected and global society, we also grapple with the question of how our systems of governance should evolve. One compelling vision draws inspiration from both ancient spiritual wisdom and cutting-edge technology: the governance of the New Jerusalem.

In this envisioned model, the government of New Jerusalem is a representative system, where decision-making bodies consist of individuals who embody not just expertise, but also virtues of the heart - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, self-control, goodness, and faithfulness. But how can we ensure that these qualities genuinely exist in those who wield power? This is where we combine the ancient and the futuristic in an unprecedented way.

New Jerusalem proposes a system in which decision-makers bear the 'Seal of God'. This isn't a physical marker, nor is it a mere symbolic title. Instead, it's a seal of authenticity, given form through mind-reading technology. This technology verifies that the decision-makers, when they cast votes or make decisions, are indeed filled with the virtues they are expected to uphold.

At its core, this idea revolutionizes the concept of 'qualification' for governance. It's not about credentials, political maneuvering, or even past achievements. It's about the state of one's heart and mind at the moment of decision-making. This approach democratizes the decision-making bodies, making room for a diversity of people to take part in shaping the New Jerusalem.

Indeed, in this system, your past words and actions neither permit nor prohibit you from being part of the decision-making body. This reflects a compassionate understanding of human nature: people grow, change, and learn. Past mistakes should not disqualify one from serving their community, nor should past good deeds be seen as a perpetual free pass. Each decision is a fresh act, to be made with love and wisdom.

It's crucial to note that this isn't about creating a utopia without disagreement. With a diverse body of representatives, differing viewpoints will naturally arise. The difference lies in how these disagreements unfold. When decision-makers are in a state of love, peace, and patience, debates become constructive, aimed at understanding and growth rather than victory and dominance.

Ultimately, the government of New Jerusalem represents a profound shift in our vision of governance. It values heart virtues as much as intellectual qualifications, views power as a duty to serve rather than a privilege to enjoy, and encourages continuous personal growth rather than static achievement. It is a government of the people, by the virtues, and for the common good.

While we may not yet be able to implement this model in its entirety, it offers inspiring principles that can guide our societal development. Emphasizing virtues in our leaders, encouraging diversity in our decision-making bodies, and practicing forgiveness and growth - these are ideas we can strive for today, bringing us closer to the vision of New Jerusalem.
