## Introduction

Medical Assistance in Dying (MAID) is a groundbreaking and controversial legislation in Canada that offers individuals the right to access a medically-assisted death when faced with unbearable suffering. While the law aims to alleviate suffering and respect individual autonomy, it is crucial that we continue to recognize the immeasurable intrinsic and extrinsic value of a human life. As such, it is essential to explore all avenues that could potentially improve a person's mental and emotional wellbeing before resorting to MAID. One such avenue is the supervised therapeutic use of plant-based substances, such as psilocybe cubensis and cannabis, which have been shown to offer significant benefits in enhancing personal growth, self-reflection, and emotional healing.

### The Value of a Human Life

The inherent value of a human life cannot be overstated. Each individual possesses unique talents, skills, and experiences that contribute to the tapestry of human existence. The relationships we form, the kindness we share, and the impact we have on others all shape the world around us. Our lives hold great potential for love, connection, and growth, even in the face of tremendous suffering. It is, therefore, crucial that we prioritize and explore every possible opportunity to preserve and enhance life.

### The Potential of Plant-Based Therapies

Psilocybe cubensis (commonly known as "magic mushrooms") and cannabis have been utilized for centuries by various cultures for their therapeutic and spiritual properties. In recent years, scientific research has begun to explore and validate the benefits of these substances, particularly in the context of mental health and personal growth.

Psilocybin, the active compound in psilocybe cubensis, has shown promise in treating conditions such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In controlled settings, psilocybin has been found to promote introspection, emotional release, and transformative experiences that can lead to lasting positive changes in a person's outlook on life.

Similarly, cannabis has demonstrated therapeutic effects in managing pain, anxiety, and insomnia, among other conditions. Its capacity to induce relaxation, enhance creativity, and promote introspection has the potential to help individuals reconnect with themselves and their environment, fostering a deeper understanding of their experiences and emotions.

### A New Approach to MAID

Given the potential benefits of these plant-based therapies, it is essential that we consider incorporating them into the decision-making process for individuals seeking MAID. By requiring a supervised therapeutic mind-altering experience with substances like psilocybe cubensis and cannabis, we offer individuals an opportunity to explore their emotions, thoughts, and perspectives in a new light.

This approach could potentially lead to the discovery of new coping mechanisms, a renewed sense of purpose, and a rekindling of personal connections that may alter an individual's decision to pursue MAID. Furthermore, integrating these experiences into the process demonstrates a commitment to prioritizing the value of human life and exhausting all avenues of support before considering medically-assisted death.

### Conclusion

As society continues to grapple with the complexities surrounding MAID, it is our responsibility to uphold the inherent value of each human life. By requiring individuals seeking medical assistance in dying to first undergo supervised therapeutic experiences with plant-based substances like psilocybe cubensis and cannabis, we can ensure that every effort is made to explore life-affirming alternatives. In doing so, we not only honor the sanctity of human life but also promote a more compassionate and holistic approach to end-of-life care.
