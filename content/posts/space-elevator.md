The space elevator is a kind of structure which connects the surface of a large gravitational body with space.  The tallest buildings on Earth are not space elevators and there are challenges we face when we construct tall buildings.  I have discovered an architecture for overcoming these engineering challenges which divides the load using partitioning.

The tallest structure possible must make use of forces like buoyancy which oppose gravity.  I will explain the architecture in the most simple way using a thought experiment.  Create a helium balloon and tie it to the longest string possible.  At some point the downward gravitational force of the system will exceed the upward buoyant force of the helium balloon.  This buoyant system can be considered as a link in a chain of similar buoyant systems.  The end of the string on each link is connected to another balloon on another link.  We now have the ability to create a vertical structure which is taller than Mount Everest.

There are limits to the strategy of using a balloon because the buoyant force decreases as the balloon rises in the atmosphere.  The links which will be highest can have less string.  Other kinds of forces which oppose gravity could be used to account for this fact and reach greater heights.

Another way I have imagined this vertical structure is by creating a quadcopter that is tethered to a power cord and creates a link in a chain similar to how we imagined the chain of balloons and strings.  The difference between the quadcopter and power cord link is that you can begin to construct a vertical structure that looks very much like a power distribution system we use in the power grid today.  In this thought experiment of mechanized flying objects connected in a chain which forms a power distribution circuit I have thought it necessary to tether this vertical structure to a reliable power source.

I shared this space elevator idea on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEmPVD8GNbU) in 2015.  I tried to share this idea with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos because they seem to be interested in big ideas and getting into space.  My thinking is rooted in a submission I made to the National Science Foundation which would empty and refill a body of water using the least amount of energy through this kind of sharing work via a partitioning strategy.
