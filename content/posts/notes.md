I again wanted to write a post about my views on ways to allow responsible people to use mind altering substances in responsible ways.  I think about being Governor of Alabama.  I think I could be better than our current governor, Kay Ivey.  I also have this question about masks and vaccines and fear of death.  Should our governor be looking down on others who do not want to wear masks and do not want vaccines?  Her position does not seem righteous to me.  Private property owners should be able to require masks and/or vaccines.  Perhaps the governor can make rules about state owned properties and state workers.  But the governor should allow private property owners and their employers to have some freedom about the rules they want.

I instead worked on [the post about government in general](/posts/government).  This has happened before.  Now my children are awake and I will fulfill my role as a father and husband while enjoying my work while I have the opportunity to do so.  I could be Governor of Alabama in 2040.  I may not get the opportunity to be with my wife and children in 2040.  A good governor does not over commit, or try to do more than they are capable of doing.  A good governor attempts to prioritize their attention properly.
