I came across a [CIA document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-EPqRNBeUGJ2mqdPPqxmSGzoPiy5CS3i/view?usp=sharing) where a handler interacted with a psychic who tried to visit a different time and space.  I had never considered that the worlds I visit are in a different point in time within our reality and that people I meet there may perceive me as some kind of hallucination.  I had never considered that the entities I meet might be from our future.

I had a conversation where I talked about being a character in the Creator's story and the response was that we can have a relationship with the Creator and influence the Creator's story.  What kind of prayers will influence the Creator?

My son doesn't like me calling books or videos a "story".  It occurred to me that the medium for the story can restrict the experience of the story.  So listening to a good story teller is different thana reading a book written by a good story teller which is different than watching a video created by a good story teller.  We are only ever able to focus on a small part of a story when the story is in the various mediums.

What is this story we are a part of?  Is this reality merely a medium by which a story unfolds?

I again wanted to write a post about my views on ways to allow responsible people to use mind altering substances in responsible ways.  I think about being Governor of Alabama.  I think I could be better than our current governor, Kay Ivey.  I also have this question about masks and vaccines and fear of death.  Should our governor be looking down on others who do not want to wear masks and do not want vaccines?  Her position does not seem righteous to me.  Private property owners should be able to require masks and/or vaccines.  Perhaps the governor can make rules about state owned properties and state workers.  But the governor should allow private property owners and their employers to have some freedom about the rules they want.

I instead worked on [the post about government in general](/posts/government).  This has happened before.  Now my children are awake and I will fulfill my role as a father and husband while enjoying my work while I have the opportunity to do so.  I could be Governor of Alabama in 2040.  I may not get the opportunity to be with my wife and children in 2040.  A good governor does not over commit, or try to do more than they are capable of doing.  A good governor attempts to prioritize their attention properly.

I work to accomplish the goal.  If the work fails to accomplish the goal, I experience discomfot related to failure.  A reason why I fail is because of a lack of planning, especially with regard to timelines.  It is best for me to break big goals up into smaller goals so that I can accomplish mini goals within small chunks of time.

My mind can become hyper focused on problems and providing solutions to those problems.  When my mind becomes focused, it is ignoring everything else and resists being disturbed or distracted.  I should be able to put my goals into perspective with regard to their relationship with each other and space-time.

I dream of Loki.  Loki creates illusions, deceptions, and tricks.  The truth is hidden and the mind becomes ignorant, distracted, and disturbed.  Loki may do these creations for fun and without bad intentions.  When Loki creates a fake wall to hide the truth, evil people can hide behind that fake wall.  When Loki distracts the minds, evil people can move into position for their deadly attacks.  Evil people can capture and use Loki for their purposes because Loki is not honest.

I dream of a place of angels.  The angels put on a show and many people attend.  But once the show is over, people begin leaving.  We are not interested in what they say after the show.  I decide to stay and wait and see what happsn.
