I again wanted to write a post about my views on ways to allow responsible people to use mind altering substances in responsible ways.  I think about being Governor of Alabama.  I think I could be better than our current governor, Kay Ivey.  I also have this question about masks and vaccines and fear of death.  Should our governor be looking down on others who do not want to wear masks and do not want vaccines?  Her position does not seem righteous to me.  Private property owners should be able to require masks and/or vaccines.  Perhaps the governor can make rules about state owned properties and state workers.  But the governor should allow private property owners and their employers to have some freedom about the rules they want.

I instead worked on [the post about government in general](/posts/government).  This has happened before.  Now my children are awake and I will fulfill my role as a father and husband while enjoying my work while I have the opportunity to do so.  I could be Governor of Alabama in 2040.  I may not get the opportunity to be with my wife and children in 2040.  A good governor does not over commit, or try to do more than they are capable of doing.  A good governor attempts to prioritize their attention properly.

I work to accomplish the goal.  If the work fails to accomplish the goal, I experience discomfot related to failure.  A reason why I fail is because of a lack of planning, especially with regard to timelines.  It is best for me to break big goals up into smaller goals so that I can accomplish mini goals within small chunks of time.

My mind can become hyper focused on problems and providing solutions to those problems.  When my mind becomes focused, it is ignoring everything else and resists being disturbed or distracted.  I should be able to put my goals into perspective with regard to their relationship with each other and space-time.

I dream of Loki.  Loki creates illusions, deceptions, and tricks.  The truth is hidden and the mind becomes ignorant, distracted, and disturbed.  Loki may do these creations for fun and without bad intentions.  When Loki creates a fake wall to hide the truth, evil people can hide behind that fake wall.  When Loki distracts the minds, evil people can move into position for their deadly attacks.  Evil people can capture and use Loki for their purposes because Loki is not honest.
