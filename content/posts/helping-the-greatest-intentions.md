*Written by Gavin Palmer practicing a relationship with the Greatest Intentions*

The energy I invest in this thought space is dedicated toward serving the greatest intentions.  This ultimately means I am willing to put myself in service to others with my energy.

The process of creating [peace on Earth](/posts/my-goal) and solving the [Human Resource Problem](/posts/human-resource-problem) is directly related to increasing people's attention to the right ideas.  One such idea is platforming.

But who or what should we platform and how should we do it?  **The short answer: we should seek out the best intentions possible and attempt to bring our attention in alignment with that.**

Our attention is the most valuable resource in the world.  And our intentions can be shaped by the intent of the people we give our attention to.  Therefore we must be very serious about the intentions and attention of ourself and others.  This is the essence of the answer to what, who, and how we platform.

The practical and pragmatic answer is in personal practices.  I am responsible for my own attention and intentions.  I am responsible for whether I am practicing giving attention to the now, then, in, out, back, front, here, there, or whole to various degrees and depths.  I am responsible for honestly comparing who I was to who I am in relationship to the intentions I claim to have.  I suspect nobody has perfect intentions.  I suspect nobody has aligned their attention perfectly with their intentions.  And this is good because living this way is a practical and pragmatic personal practice which never ends.

As I practice recognizing when my attention is not in alignment with my intentions I also get better at recognizing when other people's attention is not in alignment with my intentions.  This helps me to identify who should be platformed and deplatformed.

I have an innovative mind.  I am serious about my intentions and attention.  I believe my innovations can help make this world a better place.  But I need help.  We the people are the essential ingredient when trying to predict and manifest the future.  Decades ago, Bucky Fuller believed we had developed the technical capacity to provide for all people's basic needs and I agree.  But we haven't had a critical mass of people being serious about seeking out the best intentions and bringing our attention into alignment with them.
