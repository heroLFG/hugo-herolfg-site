When our work is recorded and shared with the world we are facilitating the same education process which happens when open source software engineers build tools you are using to read this post right now.

# Transparency

By the end of this post, I will begin explaining new ways of integrating transparency into society.

If all work was done in the full light of transparency technologies, we would end world hunger and all threats of war within 30 years.  When people do their work behind closed doors, corruption and incompetence are able to flourish and thrive.  But when people do their work for all to see, we have the opportunity to develop a truly meritocratic society with hierarchies based on competence for the benefit of all.

For example, I am [writing this message](/posts/content-creation) for the benefit of the world using the proper technologies.  The people who are trying to write words in order to help our species need to adopt this method of working with transparency technologies as soon as possible.  This is low hanging fruit.

# Privacy

In my more immature age, I had thought that we might not need any privacy.  However, our species is not ready to reveal everything we think and do.  The primary concern of revealing everything about myself is not that I will be ashamed of who I am and what I do.  My primary concern is that the world is not prepared to properly handle and process everything about who I am and what I do.

Think about all the places that people want to be kept secret and compare that to the number of places which are kept transparent.  Our species is primarily focused on keeping our lives hidden in the dark while ignoring the process of bringing things into the light so that learning is possible.  It is no wonder why we are such an ignorant species.  We have only recently developed the technology to allow the light to shine and the ignorance to be scattered away from our most important functions of society.

# Next Steps

I am reminded of Ralph Nader wanting to put labels on our food to educate people about what they are eating.  But the technology we have today allows us to record so much more information about the food we eat.  And we can use that same technology to record information about all important work that is being done.

There will be new kinds of buildings in the future.  One such building is a place where experts at creating recordings can host work events.  People like myself would schedule a work event of various types.  Some recording studios may specialize in medicine related to maintenance and repair of the human body.  Other studios may specialize in mechanical work related to vehicles and equipment.  Another recording studio may focus on education and training for children.

Within this new recording industry, there can also be experts who can be paid to go on site and do recordings of work being done.  These experts may also provide recording services for facilities.

# Outcomes

The outcome of properly incorporating transparency technology into society is better education and understanding for society.  The best workers within your community can be identified and they will be in higher demand and can require higher prices for their products and services.  The best workers can be studied by people who are training.  The community of people interested in a specific trade or craft can provide feedback with each other to help consumers and producers gain knowledge and understanding.

The result is a better competence hierarchy.  We crowdsource the process by which experts are identified and empowered.  We solve the [human resource problem](/posts/human-resource-problem) by identifying those who are most competent and give them the power and influence they deserve.

# Limited Transparency

We don't want to share all the information because we can get overloaded with information.  Some information is more relevant.  Other information is noisy and irrelevant.  The people and organizations that provide recording services will understand the need to edit the recordings and create presentations which focus on the most relevant information.  The raw footage could be archived and made available to help with the peer review process in the recording industry.

There are also ways to integrate privacy and secrecy.  Our nuclear weapons technology and arsenal are an example of a sensitive subject where some information should be kept secret.  Software problems in financial software is also a sensitive subject.  And there are various strategies by which the relevant information is shared at the right time for the benefit of everyone involved.  Ideally, the people making decisions about what is and is not shared are trusted because they have proven their abilities and have risen within the relevant competence hierarchies of experts.

So we don't need full transparency to have peace on Earth.  But we do require enough transparency by which we trust in our competence hierarchies as they change over time.
