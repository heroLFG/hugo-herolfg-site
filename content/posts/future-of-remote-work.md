I invite you to lay back and enjoy a float down a stream of consciousness.  Or if you are the more athletic type, you might enjoy surfing this wave I discovered today.

I was looking at the dog hair on my floor and I thought about those low profile disc shaped cleaning robots.  Being a father with kids who like to play, I thought it would be cool if those robots had a remote control like an RC toy.  And then I remembered those Tesla tractor trailers and the fact that a remote operator would need to be available to assist when the weather isn't ideal.

Could I start a company that makes use of robots to provide services to people?  If I could do it then someone certainly will do it one day.

I've heard about farming equipment that is mostly autonomous and allows a remote operator to take control if needed.  Why not offer similar services with robotic vacuums and lawnmowers?  What about a future when a humanoid robot could be operated remotely to provide any service imaginable?  How many services can we imagine?

As remote operators perform tasks, the information can be used to train future automation technology.  That information could be used to better identify the gifted among us so that they might be given more opportunities to learn and teach.  That information could be used as evidence to prove that the remote operator was not behaving improperly.

I imagine a future when humans do remote work because it gives them a sense of joy, the same way a child might play with a remote control car.  And because the information is used as part of an overall education system, we should all feel a sense of purpose in this form of remote operator play.

We will gamify peace on Earth some day.  We will do it because it's fun and meaningful.
