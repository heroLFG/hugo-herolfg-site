Practice earnestly and humbly watching with determination for all saints.  When we perform this practice, we seek the ideal in relationship to our goals.  We identify our goals.  And we identify people who are better at accomplishing our goals.  Each person has different gifts and goals.  As different people with different goals practice identifying saints in relationship to their goals, we can raise up all of these saints and do something the world has never seen before.

Why identify saints?  When we properly identify the saints we learn and grow and transform as individuals and communities and communities of communities.  The individual can learn with regard to their goals within a community with similar goals.  Some individuals like myself have the goal of providing situational awareness and interoperability within and between communities.  I'm a part of the tech support community.

How do we identify a saint?  The answer provided to me by people who may or may not be saints now or in the future is that we can know them by their fruit.  Farmers can be saints.  Doctors can be saints.  Plumbers can be saints.  Tech support people can be saints.  The potential saints are everywhere.

Take plumbing for example.  How can we identify the living patron saint of plumbers?  As tech support, I suggest a technical platform and process by which plumbers are invited to record themselves doing and sharing their work.  The platform would facilitate feedback from those who received the service and others who might help identify alternative ways of work.  In this way the best plumbers in the world are identified and the best plumbing practices are identified and people have the opportunity to learn the best knowledge from the best teachers.

How do we create and manage such a system that helps identify the living patron saints of plumbing?  That requires we identify the living patron saints across many fields of knowledge.  We should attempt to help identify the best produce in those fields by identify the best producers: aka "the saints".
