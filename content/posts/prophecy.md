The words "prophecy" and "prophesy" are very similar.  The noun form, "prophecy", is defined as "true information received from a source which is different from our physical sense organs".  The person who receives  information is defined as a prophet.  And when the prophet shares the information with others we have the verb form of the word "prophesy".  Note the different spelling and the different pronunciation.

In the following video, Paul Stamets received prophecy and is therefore a prophet.  My claim is that we should be seeking out prophets.  My prayer is to one day connect with Paul Stamets and have a conversation with him about the future.

Our most valuable resource is attention if we are trying to do [sensemaking](/posts/how-to-do-sensemaking).  And the most important problem is the [human resource problem](/posts/human-resource-problem).  And we should be creating an environment which is conducive for people to raise up their hand and say "it seems I am a prophet".  And our prophets should be having serious conversations which are treated seriously by the people of the world so that we can have more peace on Earth.

# Kinds of Prophecy

The purpose of prophecy is to help people aim correctly.  God allows us to identify God's messengers when God gives the prophecy to the prophets.  This is how God helps us do our sensemaking.

## Past Information Prophecy

The purpose of past information prophecy is to help people find God's messengers on Earth.

Sometimes, the recipient of this prophet's message will open their mouth like a fish out of water as they struggle to understand how the prophet could have known such things about their private lives.

The risk of this prophecy is that the listeners will accuse others of sharing secrets with the prophet.  They will not immediately consider that they are in the presence of a prophet who has received the secrets from God so that they would be able to identify one of God's messengers: especially in our modern times when belief in prophets has been undermined by so many institutions who have been given too much authority.

## Future Information Prophecy

The prophet can share information about outcomes which are bad and can be avoided.  And the prophet can share information about outcomes which are good and we should aim for.

In our modern world when we do not seek out prophets, the prophet often receives the prophecy and doesn't really know what to do with it.  We should try to create an environment so that prophecy and prophets are sought after by the people of Earth.  We want prophecy to be shared for our benefit instead of hidden because the prophet fears ridicule.

## Spiritual Information Prophecy

The prophet can share information about a person's spirit: knowing the person better than the person knows their self.  This is very useful information for solving the human resource problem.  However, most people get very defensive when the truth of their spirit (or character) with all of its corresponding strengths and weaknesses are revealed to them.

The way we become a prophet is to seek the truth: even when it causes fear and pain.  We tune our self which is the instrument and the temple where we meet God.  Some have progressed along the path further than others.
