## notes

We are each an elephant and an elephant rider who justifies what the elephant does.  My elephant is an engineer.

My reminders (https://herolfg.com/posts/reminders/) are some of my conclusions about how I should practice acting in the world.  I could go through each word like "cooperate" and ask the question "how" and "when" while considering some of Axelrod's book "The Evolution of Cooperation".

Experimentation facilitates error correction.

### questions

What are your criticisms?  If you were the master, what would you want to happen or change?

My elephant is an engineer.  What is your elephant?

How can it be utilized for productivity?

Is the question productive?

What am I doing? Practicing perspectvism: cooperation and coeducation

What deserves my attention?  Husband, Father, Engineer

Why do I publicly talk to strangers? Teach how to Listen, Learn, Love, and Respect
    - How can I relate with others?
        - Start by stating intentions.
        - End by stating highlights in reference to the intentions.
        - Roles
            - Speaker: do not speak for too long.
            - Listener: take notes then reflect.
            - Reflector: share interpretation to the speaker's satisfaction.
        - Recognition
            - Social awareness game: empathy practice; listener focuses on speaker's experiences; avoid acting like the coach;
            - Self awareness game: identify emotions practice; notice what arises within self;
        - Regulation
            - Self management game: be impeccable;
            - Relationship management game: conflict resolution; error correction;
        - Sensemaking game:
            - identify the topic
            - take turns being speaker, listener, and reflector
        - Notes:
            - Bad coaches don't like being coached.

### interview questions

What do you think about reputation and status?

What are you passionate about?
    - What do you consciously give your attention to?
    - What unconsciously grips your attention?

What are your game theories and strategies?
    - What are your values and your hierarchy of values?
    - What are your moral foundations?

        - what about create a better game?
        - what about tribalism?

Karl Popper and falsifiability.
    - All swans are white.  We can't observe all swans, but observing one black swan would falsify the claim.

### definitions

Perspectivism, as a worldview, sees all knowledge of a subject as being inevitably partial and limited.

Perspectivism, as a practice, appreciates and attempts to understand different perspectives. (listening)

Praxeology is the study of action. (intentional, unintentional => conscious, unconscious => voluntary)

Phsyics is the study of unconscious action.

Biology is the study of conscious action.

Psychology is the study of human action. (distributions, elections)

Economics is the study of social interaction. (secrets, lies, ignorance, information, noise)

Cybernetics is the study of communications in relationship to system outputs. (education)

Cybernetics, as a practice, uses observation of outcomes to actions as inputs for further action.

Technology is the study of tools.

Engineering is the creation and use of technology. (systems engineering)

Systems theory (isolated, closed, and open systems; synergy and emergent behavior)

Information theory (entropy, observability, controllability)

Control theory (control of dynamical systems, Kalman filter)

Theory of value (intrinsic, labor, exchange, monetary, power, utility, subjective)

Legal systems (common law and precedent, statutory law, regulatory law, what about claims of injury being ignored?)

### thoughts

Game theory: put agents in different games to see which game is better and answer questions like:
    - How many tribes?
        - How many good tribes?
            - What is a good tribe?
                - How do I create a good tribe?
    - Should there be gatekeepers who restrict access?
        - Game theory shows a preference to punish freeloaders because working agents earn more.
    - Who should be the gatekeepers who restrict access?
        - The set of rules could be the primary gatekeeper and there can be a process by which the set of rules change.
            - The set of rules may be considered "culture" and I think about "honor culture" and Tecumseh.
                - I think about Maschiach, Madhi, and The Helper (Spirit of Truth / Holy Spirit)
                    - https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15&version=ERV
            - The process of process improvement: Eli Goldratt and the Theory of Constraints and Critical Chain

Passion: Obsessed with knowledge. Obsessed with winning. Obsessed wtih creating.  Obsessed with ordering.  Obsessed with purity.

Every experience is a causal force which can be studied within praxeology because every experience changes the perceiver's perspective.

Simulation shows that small preferences can lead to segregation.

Simulation of cellular automata show the effects of rules and starting conditions in an experiment.
