## notes

Experimentation facilitates error correction.

### questions

How can it be utilized for productivity?

Is the question productive?

What am I doing? Practicing perspectvism: cooperation and coeducation

What deserves my attention?  Husband, Father, Engineer

### people and ideas

Anatol Rapoport and tit-for-tat
    - won tournament based on Robert Axelrod's Evolution of Cooperation
    - science for peace (http://scienceforpeace.ca/ - does not appear to uphold personal responsibility)
        - what about create a better game?
        - what about tribalism?

Karl Popper and falsifiability.
    - All swans are white.  We can't observe all swans, but observing one black swan would falsify the claim.
    - All people are sinners.

Alfred Korzybski and general semantics.
    - The map is not the territory.

Albert Ellis and REBT.
    - The A-B-C-D-E-F model against self defeating beliefs.
    - Good (Jocko Willink and warrior mindset)
    - Teachings of Don Juan (impecability and warrior mindset)
    - Carol Dweck and growth mindset.

### definitions

Perspectivism, as a worldview, sees all knowledge of a subject as being inevitably partial and limited.

Perspectivism, as a practice, appreciates and attempts to understand different perspectives. (listening)

Praxeology is the study of action. (intentional, unintentional => conscious, unconscious => voluntary)

Phsyics is the study of unconscious action.

Biology is the study of conscious action.

Psychology is the study of human action. (distributions, elections)

Economics is the study of social interaction. (secrets, lies, ignorance, information, noise)

Cybernetics is the study of communications in relationship to system outputs. (education)

Cybernetics, as a practice, uses observation of outcomes to actions as inputs for further action.

Technology is the study of tools.

Engineering is the creation and use of technology. (systems engineering)

Systems theory (isolated, closed, and open systems; synergy and emergent behavior)

Information theory (entropy, observability, controllability)

Control theory (control of dynamical systems, Kalman filter)

Theory of value (intrinsic, labor, exchange, monetary, power, utility, subjective)

Legal systems (common law and precedent, statutory law, regulatory law, what about claims of injury being ignored?)

### thoughts

Game theory: put agents in different games to see which game is better and answer questions like:
    - How many tribes?
        - How many good tribes?
            - What is a good tribe?
                - How do I create a good tribe?
    - Should there be gatekeepers who restrict access?
        - Game theory shows a preference to punish freeloaders because working agents earn more.
    - Who should be the gatekeepers who restrict access?
        - The set of rules could be the primary gatekeeper and there can be a process by which the set of rules change.
            - The set of rules may be considered "culture" and I think about "honor culture" and Tecumseh.
                - I think about Maschiach, Madhi, and The Helper (Spirit of Truth / Holy Spirit)

                    - https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15&version=KJV
            - The process of process improvement: Eli Goldratt and the Theory of Constraints and Critical Chain

Passion: Obsessed with knowledge. Obsessed with winning. Obsessed wtih creating.  Obsessed with ordering.  Obsessed with purity.

Every experience is a causal force which can be studied within praxeology because every experience changes the perceiver's perspective.

Simulation shows that small preferences can lead to segregation.

Simulation of cellular automata show the effects of rules and starting conditions in an experiment.
