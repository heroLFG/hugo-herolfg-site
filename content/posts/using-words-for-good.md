Because violence is the result of a failure to communicate I try to improve my communication skills and share knowledge.
 
I am responding to [Nathan Ormond's blog post](https://nathanormond.wordpress.com/2020/12/23/sorities-paradoxes/) about [Sorites Paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/).
 
All words are vague and [communication is hard](https://fallibleideas.com/communication-is-hard).  Some words are more vague than other words.  Some people will make the mistake of possessing an understanding of a word and assuming that other people have the same understanding of the word or phrase.  Words are technology and I use words to try and develop an understanding of the ideas within other people's minds.  Through communication I can learn that the other person uses words which I will not use to describe the same idea.
 
I teach my children about the words "male" and "female" because they are less vague than the words "boy", "man", "gentleman", "girl", "woman", and "lady".  I can live my entire life without using the more vague words and save a lot of energy with regard to the goal of communicating with other people.  I remember a black friend who got mad at me when I called him "boy".  Since then, I avoid using the word "boy" and encourage other people to use better words.
 
In modern times people have been carelessly using the word "racism".  The word "racism" is even more vague than the word "heap" (see the sorites paradox link above).  They are ultimately meaningless words.  They are useless words if your goal is to reduce violence in the world and understand that violence is the result of a failure to communicate.
 
I want to point out that the meaning of the word "racism" has been changing rapidly.  At one point in recent history, the word "racism" brought about images of a group of selfish and hateful white people torturing and killing an innocent black person.  But at this point in history the word "racism" can bring about the image of a person who says the wrong word or phrase.
 
I like the word "confusion".  Very different meanings of the word "racism" are held within the minds of the people and there is an unhealthy fusion of those meanings playing out violently within society.  The meaning of the word "racism" has been polluted.  People were taught that racism is bad.  Then people were taught to see racism everywhere and in everything.  And now people see everything is bad.
 
I want to speak with the people who are using words in ways which cause the most dangerous confusion and try to help reduce the confusion which is happening.
 
There are many words and phrases which are being used which is causing confusion in the world.  People believe we are experiencing a pandemic with COVID-19.  The word "pandemic" doesn't mean anything to me.  People believe cannabis is a gateway drug.  The word "drug" doesn't mean anything to me.  People believe there was no fraud in the 2020 election for POTUS.  The word "fraud" doesn't mean anything to me.  There are so many of these words which are absolutely meaningless but are believed.  The result is a population of people who believe strongly about words and phrases which they have never tried to explore through research and conversation.
