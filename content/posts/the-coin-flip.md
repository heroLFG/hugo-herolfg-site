At the core of every human being is a duality that shapes our decisions, our personalities, and ultimately, our lives. This dichotomy is often unseen, ignored, or even denied. However, for some, it is a well-known companion and a critical tool for managing their persona. As a self-confessed narcissist, the interplay between my drive for power and the pursuit of humility is a perennial tightrope walk, a 'coin flip' in the most literal sense.

Many view narcissism as a dangerous character flaw, a destructive force driven by ego, self-centeredness, and a relentless thirst for power. That's an oversimplified perspective, one that overlooks the introspection some narcissists engage in to curtail these tendencies. As someone who has made this leap, I must tell you - this road to self-awareness and humility is a difficult one.

The lure of power is enticing. Its potential to alter our lives, to reshape the world around us, to make us masters of our destiny is irresistible, especially for individuals with a narcissistic bent. However, being aware of this drive for power, acknowledging its risks, and deliberately exercising restraint is a daunting task.

When I speak of "the coin flip," I refer to an approach that balances my inherent inclination for control and authority with the humility I strive to practice. A random number generator, or "coin flip," symbolizes the randomness that life often presents us with and our decision to yield to it. It's a way of conceding control, embracing uncertainty, and learning to trust the process.

The "coin flip" is not a relinquishing of responsibilities or a shirking of duties. Instead, it's a democratic strategy for group decision-making. It's applicable when decision-makers find themselves at an impasse, when debates and discussions have run their course, yet a consensus seems elusive. It's a practice of surrendering to randomness, of accepting that we don't always have the answers, and that's okay. It is an embodiment of the humility we seek and the power we wield.

By choosing to entrust our choices to the "coin flip", we allow ourselves to experience the humbling nature of uncertainty, to accept the inevitability of not always being in control. This practice humanizes us, tames our narcissistic tendencies, and brings us closer to those we interact with. It's a significant part of my journey towards bettering myself and might just be a powerful tool for others too.

My wife was right. Gaining power did open my eyes and change me. It taught me that with power comes the ability to affect change, to shape destiny, but also the necessity to embrace humility. The "coin flip" stands as a testament to this journey, a poignant reminder of the balance I seek, and perhaps, an insight for those who walk this path alongside me.
