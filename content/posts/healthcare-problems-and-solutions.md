# Problem: Limited Supply of Healthcare Resources

People report the COVID-19 pandemic leads to hospitals being overcrowded with COVID-19 patients which strains the healthcare system.

# Short-term Solution: Allow Assisted Suicides

There are situations where patients should be allowed to know if they are occupying vital healthcare resources which could be given to other patients.  A patient should be allowed to give their resources to other people.  The patient's pain and suffering could be eased with medications administered by volunteers.

- I could be trained to administer pain medication to assisted suicide patients within 3 weeks.
    - These patients have indicated that they do not fear mistakes from volunteers.

# Long-term Solution: Remove Barriers to Entry

Every person who is willing and able to provide professional healthcare services should have the opportunity to do so with minimal barriers to entry.

- There should be no organizations which work to limit the supply of healthcare professionals.
- The cost of becoming a healthcare professional should be as low as possible.
- I could be trained to provide many healthcare services to COVID-19 patients within 3 weeks.
