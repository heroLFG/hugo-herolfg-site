When we help to build a good platform for one popular person we are also building a platform which can be used by any popular person.  You may never meet a person more qualified than myself to help build such a platform.

Some thoughts about the platform I could help to build:
- channel explaining goals and paths and rules kept up to date
- channel(s) per target audience for identifying important information using crowd sourcing
    - rules allowing people to share information they think is important for target audience
    - rules allowing people to react to posts they think are important for target audience
- channel(s) for 1-on-1 conversations which all people can read but only 2 people can write to
- channel(s) for groups like admins visible to all but only only writeable for those in the group
- channel(s) connected to an rss feed
- channel(s) connected to an email address
- channel(s) for workflow automation like:
    - adding a bumper to a video
    - stripping the audio from the video
    - posting the video to youtube/etc
    - posting the audio to podbean/etc
    - posting links to social media
- channel(s) transmitting posts to social media using a bot
- channel(s) receiving responses from social media posts
- channel(s) linked to a webpage where people can post anonymously into that channel
- channel(s) for people based on payment via patreon
- channel(s) which connect discord servers
- channel(s) for sharing content connected to bot
    - content is automatically added to a library like this-little-corner.com
    - video for storytellers
    - text for writers
    - audio for musicians
    - images for artists

I had to stop for now.  But once I turn on the receiver, the ideas will flow.
