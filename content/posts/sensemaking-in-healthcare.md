# Introduction

One of my first posts was about a universal problem I called the [Human Resource Problem](/posts/human-resource-problem) (HRP).  If the universal problem is HRP then the universal solution is [Sensemaking](/posts/how-to-do-sensemaking).

I want to point our attention at our healthcare problems and attempt to shine light on some more specific human resource problems and sensemaking solutions in our healthcare system.

## Health Problems

We all experience healthcare problems in our lives.  And the people who are licensed and approved to provide healthcare solutions to our healthcare problems make mistakes.  And when we are fortunate enough to learn the root cause of our healthcare problems, all of those "healthcare professionals" who failed to identify the root cause have an opportunity to learn and grow and participate in the improvement of the entire healthcare system.
