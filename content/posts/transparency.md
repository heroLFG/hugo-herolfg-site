*Written by Gavin Palmer*

I have read about [the value of transparency](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#transparency) at Gitlab and [default to transparency](https://buffer.com/transparency) at Buffer.  I want to experiment with transparency more at HeroLFG.

I think there is greater risk of wasting time and attention when people communicate privately.  I hope that a policy of transparency will encourage people to be more careful with their words which should translate into being more respectful of other people's time.  I also want to be able to share the things people are saying with the whole team so that they are able to provide feedback.

I don't enjoy pointing out the mistakes people are making unsolicited.  But because we are humans, we are certainly making mistakes.

If you want our team to try and identify mistakes you are making, you will need to join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/wTsBWce) and speak to us in a public way.

If you think I (Gavin Palmer) am making mistakes, you can use the [discord server](https://discord.gg/wTsBWce) to connect with me and help me understand your perspective.
