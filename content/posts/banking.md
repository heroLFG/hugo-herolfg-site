I do not intend to condemn anyone.  I'm just trying to explain why we need to think about transforming the way currency flows from productive people to those who are less productive.  Once we understand some of the problems with the way currency flows in our world we are left searching for solutions.

# The Golden Rule

Those who have the gold make the rules.  The distribution of power is based on the flow of currency.

Productive people are required to give their currency directly to the federal government who then distribute the currency to less productive people.  The flow of currency results in a centralization of power in the hands of people in the federal government which results in a few problems.

## Funda-mental Economic Problem

The funda-mental economic problem with having a large federal government being the source of currency for the less productive people is the confusion within the minds of the less productive people.  The less productive people begin to see the large federal government as the good and productive provider.  This leads many people to develop a bias in favor of the perceived provider instead of the truly productive people who are more deserving of respect and recognition.

## Corruptability Problem

The centralization of currency into the hands of people in the federal government attracts the attention of self-serving and other-sacrificing people.  When desigining and engineering an important system, experts will recommend against introducing a single point of failure.  Yet this is exactly what we have done with our system of moving currency from productive people to less productive people.

## Thinking About Solutions

I would like to encourage productive people to be more involved in the process by which less productive people receive charity.

I tasted the idea of local governments providing vouchers to local people who are less productive.  These vouchers can be used as currency in the local economy when there is approval.  But who all should approve of the way the voucher is used?

I would favor a local government that supported local workers providing for goods and services instead of foreign workers providing for goods and services because I want each community to be resilient and self sufficient.  I would also like the local productive people helping to decide where the vouchers can be used.
