# Leadership



## Love

Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love G-d.  The second greatest commandment is to love your neighbor as yourself.  Whether you are trying to love G-d, your neighbor, or yourself: the key to being a loving person is to be a person who tries to listen and understand.

Herein lies the source of corruption throughout our species and all sizes of organizations we build and maintain through our participation.

In order to become and seek out good leadership, we must be interested in feedback because feedback helps us do error correction and transformation towards the better.  And in order to receive feedback, we must be able to listen and understand the source of that feedback.  And in order to listen and understand we must have love in our heart.

## Deception

The leader should never intentionally deceive people without their consent.

With regard to the President of the United States (POTUS), he has historically been a leader of a team which does not include all of the citizens of the United States.  Some citizens are a realistic threat to the life of the POTUS.  And when the POTUS delivers information publicly, some of the audience includes people who are not citizens and do not want what's best for the United States.  Even more concerning, are the people who do want what's best for the United States, think they know what's best, are wrong, and are unwilling to learn.  It is therefore perfectly reasonable for people serving as POTUS to deceive their enemies who wish harm on the individual POTUS or the team which the POTUS serves.

Some people do not want what's best for you.  They are by definition your enemy.  And deception is a method which can be used to confuse your enemy.  For example, you might broadcast a message indicating a time and location for your arrival.  That would be very useful information to your enemy.  In order to confuse your enemy, you could use deception about the time and location of your arrival.

In order to help identify imposters on your team, you can leak false information to the different individuals to help determine who can not be trusted.  We need to use tests and simulations to identify people who can be trusted.  I therefore advocate for a process by which the official team gives explicit consent to being deceived.
