# Judging Others

Related to Matthew 7

> Judge not, that ye be not judged.

> For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

A childish mind will become stressed about their appearances and how others will perceive them because the childish mind interprets superficial appearances too quickly and with too much confidence and without curiousity.

- Do not judge people by the way they look.
- Other people should not judge you by the way you look.

> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

> Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

A childish mind will belittle other people's work even when it is inferior to their own work.

> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.

I do not know how to cast motes out of other people's eyes.  I do know many ways to fail at casting motes out of other people's eyes.

> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.

Know what is holy.  The most sacred thing I know is children and the process of maturing the childish mind.
