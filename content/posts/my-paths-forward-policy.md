I am willing to spend over 1 hour per day on average having public conversations with people on the internet.  You can join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5XhBA8K), connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herolfg/), or connect with me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/herolfgdotcom).  I plan on building a better discussion plugin for this site instead of disqus and recommending against using disqus for now.

If you ask me a publicly visible question, I will eventually respond.  I will usually respond within 48 hours.  If I don't respond within 48 hours, do not hesitate to ask the question again and try to mention my username specifically to help get my attention.

I am not a popular person and do not require a policy for scale at this time.  If I ever begin to feel overwhelmed by my policy, I will try to improve it without sacrificing my own effort to have helpful conversations.
