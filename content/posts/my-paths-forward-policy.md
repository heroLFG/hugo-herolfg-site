The [Paths Forward policy idea was developed by Elliot Temple](http://fallibleideas.com/paths-forward).

### My Policy

I am willing to spend over 1 hour per day on average having public conversations with people on the internet.  You can join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/5XhBA8K), connect with me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/herolfg/), or connect with me on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/herolfgdotcom).  I plan on building a better discussion plugin for this site instead of disqus and recommend against using disqus for now.

If you ask me a publicly visible question, I will eventually respond.  I will usually respond within 48 hours.  If I don't respond within 48 hours, do not hesitate to ask the question again and try to mention my username specifically to help get my attention.

I am not a popular person and do not require a policy for scale at this time.  If I ever begin to feel overwhelmed by my policy, I will try to improve it without sacrificing my own effort to have helpful conversations.

### My Responses to Criticism:

#### Feedback from RS

> If one takes the time to respond to everything, there is a dizzying overload of information - so much so that it's virtually impossible to catalogue, respond, and make any sense out of a conversation (paralysis by analysis - why direct democracy was nixed early on in most scaled civilizations). - RS on 06/05/2020

I will deal with this problem when I face it.  But the idea that makes sense to me is to respond by creating new publicly available content and sharing a link to that content.  This allows me to share links to questions which have been answered before.

I do think that a crowd sourcing policy is necessary to handle many conversations at scale.  I also think a policy which favors other people who have their own paths forward policy can help as well.

I see that almost nobody has a policy for allowing volunteers to help correct errors that are happening.  It is irrational to not even try and allow other people to help correct my errors.  I have tried to volunteer my problem solving ability with many people and organizations which ultimately ignore me.  I suspect that encouraging people to have a policy for allowing people like me to help them will potentially transform the entire world over time.  But it will take time.  Become the change you wish to see.
