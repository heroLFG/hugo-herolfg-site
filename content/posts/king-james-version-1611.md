## The Translators - To King James

https://archive.org/details/KJV1611/page/n1/mode/2up

To the most high and mighty Prince, James by the grace of G-d, King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, Defender of the Fath, &c.

The translators of The Bible, with Grace, Mercy, and Peace, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Great and manifold were the blessings, most dread Sovereign, which Almighty G-d, the Father of all Mercies, bestowed upon us the people of England, when first he sent your Majesty's Royal person to rule and reign over us.  For whereas it was the expectation of many, who wished not well unto our Scion, that upon the setting of that bright Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth of most happy memory, some thick and palpable clouds of darkness would so have overshadowed this land, that men should have been in doubt which way they were to walk, and that it should hardly be known, who was to direct the unsettled State: the appearance of your Majesty, as of the Sun, in his strength, instantly dispelled those supposed and surmised mists, and gave unto all that were well affected, exceeding cause of comfort; especially when we beheld the government established in your Highness, and your hopefull Seed, by an undoubted Title, and this also accompanied with Peace and tranquility, at home and abroad.

But among all our Joys, there was no one that more filled our hearts, than the blessed continuance of the Preaching of G-d's sacred word among us, which is that inestimable treasure, which excels all the riches of the earth, because the fruit thereof extends itself, not only to the time spent in this transitory world, but directs and disposes men unto that Eternal happiness which is above in Heaven.

Then, not to suffer this to fall to the ground, but rather to take it up, and to continue it in the state, wherein the famous predecessor of your Highness did leave it; Nay, to go forward with the confidence and resolution of a man in maintaining the truth of Christ, and propagating it far and near, is that which has so bound and firmly knit the hearts of all your Majesty's loyal and Religious people unto you, that your very Name is precious among them, their eye does behold you with comfort, and they bless you in their hearts, as that sanctified person, who under G-d, is the immediate author of their true happiness.  And thus their contentment does not diminish or decay, but every day increases and takes strength, when they observe that the zeal of your Majesty towards the house of G-d, does not lack or go backward, but is more and more kindled, manifesting itself abroad in the furthest parts of Christendom, by writing in defense of the Truth, (which has given such a blow unto that man of Sin, as will not be healed) and every day at home, by Religious and learned discourse, by frequenting the house of G-d, by hearing the word preached, by cherishing the teachers thereof, by caring for the Church as a most tender and loving nourishing Father.

There are infinite arguments of this right Christian and Religious affection in your Majesty: but none is more forcible to declare it to others, than the vehement and perpetuated desire of the accomplishing and publishing of this Work, which now with all humility we present unto your Majesty.  For when your Highness had once out of deep judgment apprehended, how convenient it was, That out of the Original sacred tongues, together with comparing of the labors, both in our own and other foreign Languages, of many worthy men who went before us, there should be one more exact Translation of the holy Scriptures into the English tongue; your Majesty did never desist, urge and to excite those to whom it was commended, that the work might be hastened, and that the business might be expedited in so decent a manner, as a matter of such importance might justly require.

And now at last, by the Mercy of G-d, and the continuance of our Labors, it being brought unto such a conclusion, as that we have great hope that the Church of England shall reap good fruit thereby; we hold it our duty to offer it to your Majesty, not only as to our King and Sovereign, but as to the principal mover and Author of the Work.  Humbly craving of your most Sacred Majesty, that since things of this quality have ever been subject to the censures of ill meaning and discontented persons, it may receive approbation and Patronage from so learned and judicious a Prince as your Highness is, whole allowance and acceptance of our Labors, shall more honor and encourage us, then all the calumniations and hard interpretations of other men shall dismay us.  So that, if on the one side we shall be traduced by Popish persons at home or abroad, who therefore will malign us, because we are poor Instruments to make G-d's holy Truth to be yet more and more known unto the people, whom they desire still to keep in ignorance and darkness: or if on the other side, we shall be maligned by self-conceited brethren, who run their own ways, and give liking unto nothing but what is framed by themselves, and hammered on their Anvil; we may rest secure, supported within by the truth and innocense of a good conscience, having walked the ways of simplicity and integrity, as before the Lord; And sustained without, by the powerful Protection of your Majesty's grace and favor, which will ever give countenance to honest and Christian endevors, against bitter censures, and uncharitable imputations.

The Lord of Heaven and earth bless your Majesty with many happy days, that as his Heavenly hand has enriched your Highness with many singular, and extraordinary Graces; so you may be the wonder of the world in this later age, for happiness and true felicity, to the honor of that Great G-d, and the good of his Church, through Jesus Christ our Lord and only Savior.
