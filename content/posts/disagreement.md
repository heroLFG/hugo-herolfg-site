Facebook doesn't have a thumbs down reaction.  And even if it did have a thumbs down reaction that reaction could get lost in the noise of other reactions.  A disagreement is potentially the most valuable signal of all because it is an opportunity for learning to take place.

When I share this post on the internet with you it is an invitation to a discussion so that learning may take place.  I will try to understand the ideas you are trying to communicate through words.  And I ask that you try to understand the ideas that I am trying to communicate through words.  I am not the best communicator.  And so I ask for your patience with me.  I will be patient with you.  You can help me learn to be a better communicator.

We should both go into a conversation with a [growth mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Dweck) which is able to update previously held ideas with better ideas based on good reasons.  I have found that most people are sharing content which they are not willing to discuss.  The sharing is merely an effortless broadcasting of information which is not interested in valuable feedback.

Most people are not trying to continue their education.  Most people are not trying to learn.  Are you trying to learn?  Do you care if other people learn the valuable ideas you possess?  If you answer yes then we need to learn how to have a productive discussion.  You may be interested in [my policy](/posts/my-paths-forward-policy) for engaging in productive discussion.
