# Introduction

I want to prepare for an Amazon interview.

# How to Respond to Interview Questions
- STAR (Situation Task Action Result)
- SBI (Situation Behavior Impact)

# Amazon SDE Interview

# Amazon Behavioral Interview

{{< youtube CpcxVE5JIX4 >}}

You know when you are being asked a behavioral question when your interviewer says something like "tell me about a time when ...".  The recommendation is to use SBI and focus on what you did as an individual instead of what your team did.

Know the 14 leadership principles and be prepared to explain situations where I demonstrated the leadership principle.

## Possible Questions I Will Be Asked

Describe a time when you went above and beyond what was expected to help a customer.

Tell me about a time you failed at work.

Describe a time when you overcamse a difficult challenge at work.

Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with somebody at work.

## Possible Questions I Can Ask

What are the plans for Amazon over the next 5 to 10 years and how could I help you achieve them in the role?

Amazon is always bringing out new products an services, what are the next great innovations Amazon is concentrating on right now?

What is the first thing you would like me to concentrate on in this role?

# Notes

One leadership principle is "Hire and Develop the Best".  I have done most of my learning doing OJT or "on the job training".  So this principle will tend to exclude people who are very good at OJT but have not learned enough through past work experience.  The STAR and SBI template also indicates that Amazon has a preference for people who have actual work experience.  This reminds me of recruiters who want the "purple squirrel" candidate that will "check every box" instead of a candidate more like myself who can be trained and coached.  I think there is a question embedded within this principle about "what is the best".  And I think smart people will have disagreements about the answer to this question.

# Background

I wasn't looking for a new job, and I was ignoring emails from recruiters.  I ignored 2 recruiters from Amazon who both reached out to me on 03/11/21.  But a third Amazon recruiter reached out to me on 03/23/21 with a better email subject line: "Quick yes or no".  I ended up passing their online test for the first time (I think I have tried and failed at least 3 times before this time).

I think Amazon is building the technology which can help solve important problems like world hunger.  I was talking with [Rami Rustom](https://ramirustom.blogspot.com/) a few days ago about helping the homeless in his city.  I talked about how the technology used at Amazon could be used to help the homeless in his city and eventually the entire world.  A human can indicate what they need or want, and Amazon can deliver it to them.  A non-profit could build an interface between people in need (like the homeless) and people who want to help (like me) and allow them to use platforms like Amazon to provide things like food to those who are in need.  Imagine that each human has a device which tracks their GPS coordinates.  The food needed by the human could be delivered to the human's exact location.

One of the things I remember hearing about in an earlier phone screening with Amazon years ago is that each year they allow people in Amazon to submit a proposal about an idea which can be voted on and presented.  This is an opportunity to allow employees at Amazon to have a voice that doesn't get ignored.  And this is one of the reasons why I am interested in becoming an Amazon employee.  But becoming an Amazon Senior Software Engineer is no easy task.
