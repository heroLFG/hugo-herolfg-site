# What are my goals?

I learn.  I give intent.  I invite feedback.  I give progress.  I give outcomes.

# What is government?

Government is a system which has inputs, outputs, functions, and goals.

# What is government corruption?

The perception of government corruption emerges when people disagree with government activities.

# How can we reduce government corruption?

Let us imagine a world where people have learned to be righteous so that there is no perception of corruption because no person disagrees with any other person's activities.

# Biblical Themes: Archetypes and Patterns

## The Garden of Eden: 

### The Home: The Not So Safe Place

The righteous person will try to create a good home for children with the goal of raising the children into righteous people.  The home is not completely safe because the children must be prepared for a world that is not completely safe and is filled with people who are not righteous.  The righteous person will tell the children what they should and should not do.  The children will ignore the righteous person, and they will experience pain and suffering because of their ignorance.  The pain and suffering can be a teacher.  The righteous person wants to provide the children with the opportunity to listen and learn to act in ways which avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.  If the children do not listen and learn then the pain and suffering is a natural consequence.  The righteous person seeks to limit the pain and suffering so that permanent damage is avoided.  This is the biblical story.

### The Home: The Place Without Pain and Suffering

Imagine a kind of padded room where various injections are administered with the intent to prioritize the child's safety over all things.  Imagine the injections would be intended to create safety and pleasure.  The child who wants a life of safety and pleasure will remain a child who is dependent on others for their lifestyle.  Other children may want a life where they provide for the children who want a life of safety and pleasure.  This arrangement could be peaceful, but it does seem meaningless on the surface.  Beneath the surface is the possibility of a kind of peace which has never existed.
