# What is government?

Broadly speaking, government attempts to conceive and accomplish goals.  Goals require behaviors and behavior is determined by the mind.  Government can be simple when an individual is responsible for themselves and interacts with no other people.

As soon as the government increases from a size of one to two, cooperation and communication is required.  As a parent, I try to facilitates my children's development of their ability to conceive and accomplish goals cooperatively with others.

# What is government corruption?

Government corruption occurs when goals are not accomplished.

At the individual level, failure to accomplish goals indicates an opportunity for the individual to learn.  Incompetence is a forgiveable form of corruption which plagues all people at all times and places.  As a parent, I allow my children to provide feedback about their opinions regarding my incompetence.  And I try to integrate that feedback into my life when my children shine light on something I can learn.

At the group level, failure to accomplish goals can be the result of individuals having competing goals.
