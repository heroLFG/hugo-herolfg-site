# What are my goals?

I learn.  I give intent.  I invite feedback.  I give progress.  I give outcomes. I seek peace.

# What is government?

Government is a system which has inputs, outputs, functions, and goals.

# What is government corruption?

The perception of government corruption emerges when people disagree with government activities.

# How can we reduce government corruption?

Let us imagine a world where people have learned to be righteous so that there is no perception of corruption because no person disagrees with any other person's activities.

# People and Government

## Patronizing and Condescending People

I will begin with some thoughts from Jacob Faturechi:

> Very few words in English have exactly the same meaning; even words which appear to be entirely synonymous often will be found to have small differences in certain contexts. The words condescending and patronizing present a fine example of this. At first glance these words appear to be defined somewhat circularly: condescending often has the word "patronizing" in its definition, and patronize is defined, in part, as “to adopt an air of condescension toward.”
> But both of these words have specialized senses that lend a shade of meaning to their synonymous senses. Patronizing can mean "giving support to" or "being a customer of," suggesting that the "condescending" sense implies superiority gained through a donor-dependent relationship.
> The verb condescend used to be free of any hint of the offensive superiority it usually suggests today. It could mean literally "to go or come down" or, figuratively, "to willingly lower oneself to another’s level," senses that are still occasionally encountered in writings on the Bible. The idea of self-consciously lowering oneself is implied in the "patronizing" sense of condescending.

Sometimes people judge themselves as being superior or better than other people.

# Biblical Themes: Archetypes and Patterns

## The Garden of Eden: 

### The Place with Pain and Suffering

The righteous person will try to create a good place for children with the goal of raising the children into righteous people.  The righteous person will explain to the children what they should and should not do.  The children will ignore the righteous person, and they will experience pain and suffering because of their ignorance.  The righteous person wants to provide the children with the opportunity to learn to act in ways which avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.  If the children do not learn then the pain and suffering is a natural consequence.  The righteous person seeks to limit the pain and suffering so that permanent damage is avoided.  We were designed to experience pain and suffering by the Creator because the Creator wants us to want to be like the Creator.

### The Place Without Pain and Suffering

Imagine a kind of padded room where all experiences are administered with the intent to prioritize the child's safety and pleasure over all things.  The child who wants a life of safety and pleasure will remain a child who is dependent on others for their lifestyle.  Other children may want a life where they provide for the children who want a life of safety and pleasure.  I think this arrangement would fall apart because we are part of the creation which the Creator intended for the purpose of wanting us to want to be like the Creator.  The place without pain and suffering would be temporary.  We could create such a place with the understanding that each child would only stay in such a place for a limited amount of time.  Each child would ultimately experiance pain and suffering as they fail to become what the Creator intended for us.  The pain and suffering will emerge as the teacher.

### The Balance

The righteous person requires no law enforcer because they have developed and maintained the proper relationship with the Creator's teacher which is pain and suffering.  The righteous person creates and enforces laws by compassionately administering pain and suffering in order to help the child to avoid causing an unnecessarily large degree of pain and suffering.  The righteous person avoids administering pain and suffering by improving their ability to teach the child in a proactive way.
