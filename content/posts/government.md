# What are my goals?

I learn.  I give intent.  I invite feedback.  I give progress.  I give outcomes. I seek peace.

# What is government?

Government is a system which has inputs, outputs, functions, and goals.

# What is government corruption?

# People and Government

## Patronizing and Condescending People

We judge ourselves to be better than other people when we ignore people's goals: our own goals and other people's goals.  Our perception of our superiority gets in the way of our ability to know people's goals and become the patron who allows other people's goals to ascend into our focus.  Cooperation with other people is a common goal for any person who has looked deeply to know their own goals.

# Biblical Themes: Archetypes and Patterns

## The Garden of Eden: 

### The Place with Pain and Suffering

The righteous person will try to create a good place for children with the goal of raising the children into righteous people.  The righteous person will explain to the children what they should and should not do.  The children will ignore the righteous person, and they will experience pain and suffering because of their ignorance.  The righteous person wants to provide the children with the opportunity to learn to act in ways which avoid unnecessary pain and suffering.  If the children do not learn then the pain and suffering is a natural consequence.  The righteous person seeks to limit the pain and suffering so that permanent damage is avoided.  We were designed to experience pain and suffering by the Creator because the Creator wants us to want to be like the Creator.

### The Place Without Pain and Suffering

Imagine a kind of padded room where all experiences are administered with the intent to prioritize the child's safety and pleasure over all things.  The child who wants a life of safety and pleasure will remain a child who is dependent on others for their lifestyle.  Other children may want a life where they provide for the children who want a life of safety and pleasure.  I think this arrangement would fall apart because we are part of the creation which the Creator intended for the purpose of wanting us to want to be like the Creator.  The place without pain and suffering would be temporary.  We could create such a place with the understanding that each child would only stay in such a place for a limited amount of time.  Each child would ultimately experiance pain and suffering as they fail to become what the Creator intended for us.  The pain and suffering will emerge as the teacher.

### The Balance

The righteous person requires no law enforcer because they have developed and maintained the proper relationship with the Creator's teacher which is pain and suffering.  The righteous person creates and enforces laws by compassionately administering pain and suffering in order to help the child to avoid causing an unnecessarily large degree of pain and suffering.  The righteous person avoids administering pain and suffering by improving their ability to teach the child in a proactive way.
