When I write about [a world without hunger](/posts/a-world-without-hunger) people wonder what I know about economics.

### The Basics

There is a supply of goods and services.  There is demand for those goods and services.  The prices of goods and services are related to supply and demand.  If a good or service is scarce the price will be higher than when that same good or service is abundant assuming all other variables like demand are the same.

### The Economic Calculation Problem

One naive criticism of an [autonomouse agriculture system](/posts/a-world-without-hunger) is the belief that the Economic Calculation Problem can not be solved.

The Economic Calculation Problem is a criticism of centralized planning which identifies the problem of being unable to calculate all of the supply and demand information within a sufficiently large economy.  This problem is related to an inability to have access to all of the relevant supply and demand information for a sufficiently large economy.  And even if we somehow had access to good enough information, the human mind would not be capable of doing a useful calculation for a sufficiently large economy.

I foresee that information networking and storage technology can be used to provide access to all of the relevant information while information processors make calculations with that information to provide necessities for everyone.

And so the Economic Calculation Problem is relevant.  But it is a problem which can be solved eventually if we tried to do so.

### Costs and Generations of an Autonomous System

An autonomous system could make use of finite raw materials combined with renewable energy to produce and deliver goods.  The cost of the system would be paid up front as an investment which would eventually result in a system that is able to produce and deliver goods with minimal need for human maintenance labor.  This would be a minimum viable product and could help provide basic goods.  The system would have a maximum capacity and it could be produced and deployed at scale.

A second generation of the autonomous system would need to be capable of facilitating self repair in addition to production and delivery.  The system would be capable of recycling its parts in order to do repairs and upgrades.  Until the second generation is complete, people will be responsible for maintaining and repairing the system's parts.

A third generation of the system would need be capable of self replication.  The system would need to be capable of producing raw materials for its operation and maintenance or it would need to harvest raw materials in order to replicate and grow.  Once the third generation is deployed, people will no longer be reqiured to do manual labor as part of the supply chain.

### Business Plan

Being able to solve the [Human Resource Problem](/posts/human-resource-problem) or create [a world without hunger](/posts/a-world-without-hunger) through technical innovation will depend on a large collection of new technologies which can add value in many different markets.  All of these innovations will come in stages over time.  A good business plan and the support of investors could allow the right people to succeed in a few different vertical markets while progressing toward ambitious goals.

### Conclusion

I suspect that our current economic system will continue to discover technologies which can be used to end world hunger eventually.  But many of our big problems can be solved sooner if we keep a bigger and better picture in our mind that gives us a sense of purpose and direction.  This requires that dreamers try to share their vision of a better future so that engineers are inspired to build the valuable technologies which can make that future a real possibility.

We don't want to be overly idealistic.  We want to be realistic and pragmatic.  I really don't see how this endeavor can fail.  The worst case scenario for good people who get involved is that we learn and and acquire valuable knowledge and technology even if we miss the mark in the end.
