# Introduction

People need to understand and agree with the goal of a system.  If people ignore the goal of a system, then the system is assuredly being wasteful and counterproductive.

# Goals
 
In the introduction to *The Goal* by Eli Goldratt, he defines science as a method for creating explanations.  But he clearly distinguishes science from knowledge.  Eli Goldratt requires knowledge to be able to make our world better and life more fulfilling.

## False Information

I was made aware of a [video from Chris Wark](https://www.instagram.com/p/CKWTDI2HTJr/) that FACEBOOK labeled as "false information".  FACEBOOK linked out to a [response by Science Feedback](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/most-positive-pcr-test-results-are-true-positives-who-information-notice-didnt-change-threshold-or-criteria-for-a-positive-test/) which states that the claim of "WHO Admits High-Cycle PCR Tests Produce COVID False Positives" is inaccurate.

I did my research and agree that Chris Wark made errors in his video.  His video does have false information.  But the article FACEBOOK linked to the video also has false information.

## True Information

Eli Goldratt defines information as the answer to the question asked.  Information can not exist separate from a question.  The people at Science Feedback are asking a different question than people like me.  Every compassionate and reasonable person is asking the question "How do we stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2?".  The "scientists" at Science Feedback claim that there is no such thing as a "false positive" because the tests which detect SARS-CoV-2 indicate that the individual has had SARS-CoV-2 even if they had it months ago and are no longer contagious.

These "scientists" are using the test to answer the question "Has this person ever had SARS-CoV-2?".  They ignore the better question we should be posing which is "How do we stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2?".  By approaching the testing with a different question and goal, these "scientists" are able to declare that the original claim is "inaccurate".  Science Feedback is being misleading because they are framing the testing around the wrong goal.

## Conclusion

My conclusion is that FACEBOOK and Science Feedback have a goal which is to discredit certain sources of information.  They ignored the underlying goal of stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2.  And by ignoring the important goal and focusing on the less important goal, they are contributing to confusion and a failure to use the SARS-CoV-2 testing technology effectively.
