## notes

Experimentation facilitates error correction.

Each worldview (or perspective) has costs and benefits or tradeoffs.  Each individual has a unique perspective which changes with each experience.  And so a specific worldview may be the most beneficial and least harmful for a specific individual at a specific time and place.  But other individuals or even the same individual at a different time and place would find such a worldview too harmful to accept.

This worldview in itself presents its own risk profile and might be too harmful for large numbers of individuals in their current time and place.

### questions

How can it be utilized for productivity?

Is the question productive?

### people and ideas

Karl Popper and falsifiability.
    - All swans are white.  We can't observe all swans, but observing one black swan would falsify the claim.

Alfred Korzybski and general semantics.
    - The map is not the territory.

Albert Ellis and REBT.
    - The A-B-C-D-E-F model against self defeating beliefs.
    - Good (Jocko Willink and warrior mindset)

### definitions

Perspectivism, as a worldview, sees all knowledge of a subject as being inevitably partial and limited.

Perspectivism, as a practice, appreciates and attempts to understand different perspectives. (listening)

Praxeology is the study of action. (intentional, unintentional => conscious, unconscious => voluntary)

Phsyics is the study of unconscious action.

Biology is the study of conscious action.

Psychology is the study of human action. (distributions, elections)

Economics is the study of social interaction. (secrets, lies, ignorance, information, noise)

Cybernetics is the study of communications in relationship to system outputs.

Cybernetics, as a practice, uses observation of outcomes to actions as inputs for further action.

Technology is the study of tools.

Engineering is the creation and use of technology. (systems engineering)

Systems theory (isolated, closed, and open systems; synergy and emergent behavior)

Information theory (entropy, observability, controllability)

Control theory (control of dynamical systems, Kalman filter)

Theory of value (intrinsic, labor, exchange, monetary, power, utility, subjective)

### thoughts

Passion: Obsessed with knowledge. Obsessed with winning. Obsessed wtih creating.  Obsessed with ordering.  Obsessed with purity.

Every experience is a causal force which can be studied within praxeology because every experience changes the perceiver's perspective.

Simulation shows that small preferences can lead to segregation.

Simulation of cellular automata show the effects of rules and starting conditions in an experiment.
