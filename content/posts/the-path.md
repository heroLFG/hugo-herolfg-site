*Written by Gavin Palmer*

My practice is to develop and maintain a good relationship with the omniscient and loving Creator so that I can help and participate in doing good work.  What is the good work I am doing?  How do I know when I am helping the Creator do good work?  How do I know when I am not helping the Creator do good work?

Humans are tranceivers.  Our mind is a receiver and our body is a transmitter.

Even when we are not doing good work, we are creating opportunity to learn and improve.

- be careful with your attention
- practice giving your full attention
- be flexible and allow plans to change
- be careful about people who have different goals
- work with people who share your goals
- remember the Creator: the peace maker
- callibrate my being toward peace embodied
