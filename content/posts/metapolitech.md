# Introduction

I'm now old enough to be President of the United States of America (POTUS).  The only reason I am considering running for POTUS is because the people who usually try to be POTUS are unable to solve the most fundamental problems we face.  My hope is that I can share information about actions the reader can perform to participate in our transformation.

## Corruption, Trustworthiness, and Funding

We are all corrupted people to one degree or another deserving limited trustworthiness.

Corruption occurs when there exists an incorrect hierarchy of values within the minds of people.  All individuals have misbehaved as a result of our susceptibility to mental health problems.  But some individuals are healthier than others, and each individual can try to become healthier.  All of the systems in existence are the result of people with various degrees of mental illness creating imperfect systems.

The trustworthiness of an individual depends on the mental health, or corruption, of the individual.  And the trustworthiness of a system depends on the trustworthiness of the people who create, maintain, and transform the system.

Funding is needed by organizations that are not self-sustaining and this is normal in markets where money is exchanged for goods and services.  But sometimes the rules of the game force organizations to acquire funding against their will.  The rules of the game can cause corruption within the individual minds and the systems they are a part of.

The individuals and the systems have goals associated with a hierarchy of values.  The rules of the game are imposed in such a way that the primary goals can become corrupted in terrible ways.  As a result, the people and the systems are not deserving of trust.

## Metapolitech

### Members

A member is anyone who has registered with the metapolitech platform.

### Candidates

A candidate is anyone who is a member of metapolitech and agrees to consult the metapolitech platform when making decisions.

### Goals

Our primary goal is to elect politicians into positions of power who will make use of the metapolitech platform for decision making.

- POTUS is a metapolitech candidate.
    - Metapolitech candidate on every ballot.
        - Candidate for POTUS in GOP is a metapolitech candidate.
        - Candidate for POTUS in the DNC is a metapolitech candidate.
        - Candidate for POTUS in LP is a metapolitech candidate.

### Funding

Members of the metapolitech platform can donate money to metapolitech.  These funds go into the member's account.  Each member can donate funds to any other member.  The metapolitech platform will make recommendations about donating to metapolitech candidates in such ways that all legal requirements are satisfied and metapolitech candidates are not concerned with financial decisions.

The algorithms used by wealthy members in donating to other members need to be open sourced, version controlled, and timestamped as evidence that metapolitech is operating legally.

### Trustworthiness and Corruption

Knowledge concerning the trustworthiness of members develops over time as problems, solutions, and actions are identified and associated with members.  The metapolitech platform is able to identify the most trustworthy individuals and decisions as recommendations to candidates who use the metapolitech platform.

The trustworthiness of the candidate is related to the person's ability to make predictions.  The members interested in becoming candidates should participate in the prediction component of the metapolitech platform.  As the technology improves, the predictions of non-human technologies analyzing the data should be able to perform better than any individual.  The best candidates will have a sense of the capability of the technology to make predictions in comparison to their own capability to make decisions using all of the information available.

The most trustworthy candidates will be entirely funded by the metapolitech platform which aims to create a veil of separation between the financiers and the candidates.  As the technology improves and the popularity of the platform grows, the trustworthiness of candidates and the system will improve as well.

## Claim Market

I strongly agree with the first sentence in [Connor McCormick's](https://twitter.com/connormcmk) idea about a [Claim Market](https://coda.io/@connor/claim-market-prototype).

> The primary problem with bullshit is that itâ€™s free. 

### Technical Claims

I suggested to Jason Delport that [the idea he was gifted](/posts/global-climate-change/) could be promoted with a competition.  We could provide a reward for anyone who disproved the physics of the system.  Jason and I don't believe the idea is bullshit and we are willing to give money to anyone who can prove that the underlying physics behind the idea is wrong.  A platform, perhaps metapolitech or some partner, could allow people to contribute towards rewards and facilitate error correction.

The challenge with such a system lies in the process by which the outcome is determined.  How will we know that a counterclaim is valid?  I would suggest that the experts attempting to win the reward should be temporarily anonymous and the judges should also be temporarily anonymous to deter the chance of conspiracy.  Once a prize has been rewarded by the judges, the expert who wins the prize has essentially made a counterclaim.  That counterclaim could become the target of a prize seeking out a new claim against that counterclaim.

A technical claim is separate from the person and a well constructed claim can be verified objectively.  This is why I prefer technical solutions to our problems if possible.

### Personal Claims

I could run for POTUS and make claims about my future behaviors.  And if the claims are well constructed, judges could objectively determine if my behaviors were in contradiction to my claims.  But the big difference between a personal claim and a technical claim is that we can't always have temporary anonymity.

The current election system will not allow a metapolitech candidate that is without an identity even if there are great arguments for such an election system.  As soon as the candidate's identity is exposed, there is an opportunity for conspiracy.

Let's imagine I run for POTUS within a political party vehicle.  One of my personal claims is that I will wear my Dickies jumpsuit while attending debates.  Another claim is that I will provide debate responses to the audience delivered by the metapolitech platform.  These claims can be objectively validated such that my failure to behave in accordance with the personal claim could result in a penalty such that my bullshit is not free.  But because everyone knows my identity, I could be offered compensation (or threatened) to behave against my claims thereby turning my claims into bullshit.

### My Personal Claim

Because we don't yet have a system which allows for an anonymous system of election and government, the only way I see out of this predicament is full transparency.

If and when I decide to run for POTUS, I would attempt to record every aspect of my life such that people can know the truth if and when bad actors attempt to persuade me.  Everything would be recorded, including what happens in the bed with my wife and matters of national security.  But the availability of these recordings would be limited to certain people at certain times such that all of the recordings would be made available to the public eventually.

If I were to become POTUS, I would work to allow digital autonomous organizations to run for and serve in positions of power within government.

## Conclusion

The best decisions and technology to serve all of the people will continue to emerge and we [invite you to participate](https://forms.gle/RNeQSxfyYbA2M1Eh6).
