# Introduction

I'm now old enough to be President of the United States of America (POTUS).  The only reason I am considering running for POTUS is because the people who usually try to be POTUS are unable to solve the most fundamental problems we face.  My hope is that I can share information about actions the reader can perform to participate in our transformation.

## Corruption, Trustworthiness, and Funding

We are all corrupted people to one degree or another deserving limited trustworthiness.

Corruption occurs when there exists an incorrect hierarchy of values within the minds of people.  All individuals have misbehaved as a result of our susceptibility to mental health problems.  But some individuals are healthier than others, and each individual can try to become healthier.  All of the systems in existence are the result of people with various degrees of mental illness creating imperfect systems.

The trustworthiness of an individual depends on the mental health, or corruption, of the individual.  And the trustworthiness of a system depends on the trustworthiness of the people who create, maintain, and transform the system.

Funding is needed by organizations that are not self-sustaining and this is normal in markets where money is exchanged for goods and services.  But sometimes the rules of the game force organizations to acquire funding against their will.  The rules of the game can cause corruption within the individual minds and the systems they are a part of.

The individuals and the systems have goals associated with a hierarchy of values.  The rules of the game are imposed in such a way that the primary goals can become corrupted in terrible ways.  As a result, the people and the systems are not deserving of trust.

## Metapolitech

### Members

A member is anyone who has registered with the metapolitech platform.

### Candidates

A candidate is anyone who is a member of metapolitech and agrees to consult the metapolitech platform when making decisions.

### Goals

Our primary goal is to elect politicians into positions of power who will make use of the metapolitech platform for decision making.

- POTUS is a metapolitech candidate.
    - Metapolitech candidate on every ballot.
        - Candidate for POTUS in GOP is a metapolitech candidate.
        - Candidate for POTUS in the DNC is a metapolitech candidate.
        - Candidate for POTUS in LP is a metapolitech candidate.

### Funding

Members of the metapolitech platform can donate money to metapolitech.  These funds go into the member's account.  Each member can donate funds to any other member.  The metapolitech platform will make recommendations about donating to metapolitech candidates in such ways that all legal requirements are satisfied and metapolitech candidates are not concerned with financial decisions.

The algorithms used by wealthy members in donating to other members need to be open sourced, version controlled, and timestamped as evidence that metapolitech is operating legally.

### Trustworthiness and Corruption

Knowledge concerning the trustworthiness of members develops over time as problems, solutions, and actions are identified and associated with members.  The metapolitech platform is able to identify the most trustworthy individuals and decisions as recommendations to candidates who use the metapolitech platform.

The trustworthiness of the candidate is related to the person's ability to make predictions.  The members interested in becoming candidates should participate in the prediction component of the metapolitech platform.  As the technology improves, the predictions of non-human technologies analyzing the data should be able to perform better than any individual.  The best candidates will have a sense of the capability of the technology to make predictions in comparison to their own capability to make decisions using all of the information available.

The most trustworthy candidates will be entirely funded by the metapolitech platform which aims to create a veil of separation between the financiers and the candidates.  As the technology improves and the popularity of the platform grows, the trustworthiness of candidates and the system will improve as well.

## Conclusion

The best decisions and technology to serve all of the people will continue to emerge and we [invite you to participate](https://forms.gle/RNeQSxfyYbA2M1Eh6).
