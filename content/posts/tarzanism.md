# Introduction

My father's religion was Tarzanism and he wanted to name me Tarzan.

## Propositions

Nature is the ultimate authority which can reject a proposition.  This sentence is a proposition, and so was the previous sentence.

## Questions

How did your mind react to my propositions?

## Desires

I want your mind to remember that your mind is a part of nature.
