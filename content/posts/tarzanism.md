# Introduction

My father's religion was Tarzanism and he wanted to name me Tarzan.  Our church was nature and it has taken the lives of many people.

## Propositions

We are a system of systems within systems.  All systems have inputs and outputs.  Each system is informed by relevant feedback which is output by any of these systems.

## My Origin Story

My only brother was born 361 days after me.  My mother died before I turned 3 years old.  And my father took us fishing often.

There are a few impressive men in my lives whose words stand out as testimony about my potential.  The truth is I'm not sure who I am and what role I am supposed to play.  But I like the idea that other people's testimony and the results of my work can speak for themselves.

My father said that he would never want to fight me because I'm the kind of person who will fight dirty.  I remember the feeling of puke in the back of my throat as my brother viciously punched my stomach.  My first instinct was to run to the bathroom and empty my stomach into the toilet.  But I received an insight that I could puke in my brother's eyeballs.  I won that fight.

My baseball coach said that he liked me because I was coachable.  I listened carefully as he taught me the fundamentals of batting, catching, and throwing.  I remember pitching a near perfect game.  I remember batting a near perfect season.  I remember making plays that surprised my oponents, my team, and myself.

My soccer coach made me the MVP because of my determination.  I won almost every header.  And almost nobody could get past me and score.

My track coach heard me mutter a few words about my friends on the team who were slacking.  He asked me to repeat what I had muttered for the whole team to hear: "laziness is hella contageous".  I was the slowest person on the fastest 4x800 team and helped our school win the state championship.

My science teacher requested me to stay after class and asked me if I believed in G-d.  He told me I could be a great teacher after he witnessed my ability to adjust my presentation after receiving feedback from the audience who could not follow my thoughts.

My dad's best friend told me that you can't teach people to be tough.  I'm not sure I agree.  But I thank G-d for the toughness gifted to me and those who choose to cooperate with me.
