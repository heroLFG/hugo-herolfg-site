# Introduction

My father's religion was Tarzanism and he wanted to name me Tarzan.  Our church was nature and it has taken the lives of many women and children.

## Propositions

Nature is the ultimate authority which can reject a proposition.  This sentence is a proposition, and so was the previous sentence.

#### Initial Thoughts on Tarzanism

I notice my spiritual health decline when I love myself more than I love G-d.  I practice being cautious of loving myself too much.  I rarely battle with loving myself too little.  But I am sure many people battle the opposite of my own temptation.  I am being informed of a possible answer to both kinds of spiritual malady.  We believe a story which can cause us to love ourselves too much or too little and the feeling which emerges can be identified as a dangerous poison which is not a holy fruit and is not beneficial to anyone.

I say my father's religion "was Tarzanism" because I think my father stopped practicing Tarzanism when he married my step mother.  He no longer goes to "church".  Our church almost killed me a few times.  I almost drowned a few times.  I felt a mild shock from lightning hitting the river upstream.  The allergic reaction to poison ivy was always miserable.  Our church could also be very enjoyable once we were properly trained to be respectful of the known and the unknown.

I do not go to church as much as I did and I plan to go more often in the future.  I was explicitly warned by a messenger from G-d that my church is a dangerous place which has taken the lives of many women and children.  Looking back at my encounter with that messenger who visited on the day of my baptism, my mother-in-law thought he was a snob because of this mentioning of women and children.  But I want to push back on that kind of response and say that a man who is taken by the river is very much like a child who has not learned to respect nature.  There is an underlying question about what it means to be a "real man" or the "divine man" or the "ideal man".
