# Abstract Summary

The monsters are within us.  The battle starts within and never ends.

## Introduction

We get to figure this out together and create peace on Earth as we solve [the biggest problem](/posts/human-resource-problem) and [embody the best answer](/posts/my-paths-forward-policy).

## Attention Feeding

Our attention is the most valuable resource in the world and vampires eat it up.  We should not feed on other people's attention and we should avoid giving our attention to vampires.  The predator who feeds on attention is a vampire.  We are the vampire pattern when we sacrifice others for our own status and power.  We fight the vampire pattern when we sacrifice our status and power for the benefit of others.  The vampire is a slave to their hunger and is unable to serve properly.

## Trained Responses

We often respond to stimuli like Pavlov's dog who was trained to salivate at the sound of a bell but we do it with words.  This is the mindless zombie within us who does not want to change our views.  We can become attached to anything: including ideas.  And we experience a sense of loss when we lose that which we have become attached to.  We all experience being a zombie who is too attached to an idea.

Our zombie response can be the result of predatory vampires.  And our zombie response can be the result of our attachment to wrong views.

## Too Much Noise

We generate too much noise when we feed on people's attention.  When we are attention vampires, the goal of our actions is to attract eyes and ears.  We might also be zombies thirsting for validation because we fear being wrong.

## Use Version Control

[Version control](https://github.com/heroLFG/hugo-herolfg-site/commits/dev/content/posts/vampires-and-zombies.md) puts our past mistakes on display for everyone to see.  And we can give credit to the people who helped us with our error correction if they agree to be given credit publicly.  The righteous people may not care about their status and might have some fun using a pseudonym like "santa impersonator".  But I think it is good for us to seek out the righteous people who practice fighting these spiritual battles.

The monsters do not use version control because doing so would be counterproductive for their goals.  Using version control, revealing mistakes, and giving credit to others would undermine their ability to feed on other people's attention.

## Point Carefully

Every time we attempt to point out the monster patterns in others we should seek out the monster patterns in ourselves.  Once we learn to properly battle the monster patterns within ourselves we will be more capable of battling against the monster patterns in others.  We are our own test subjects in this spiritual war.

When we are monsters we do not point carefully and we look down on others with condemnation.  We fail to see our own faults which are greater than those who we point at.

## Ignoring Righteous People

As we learn to do spiritual war with the monsters within we become increasingly righteous.  The most righteous people are able to enter into a relationship with a higher power outside of our spacetime.  The most righteous people are given information about the future so that we may more easily identify them and place them at the head of our society as we practice spiritual warfare.  There are always righteous people in our world who are ready to help once we decide we do not want to be monsters and we want to be serious about creating peace on Earth.

When we are monsters we do not care to seek out righteous people.  At best the monster will ignore the righteous people.  Oftentimes the monster will hate the righteous people.

## Receiving Feedback - Cybernetics

Defense against the monster within.

We should provide a mechanism by which others can help us with our error correction so that we may improve our ways.  This is fundamental to [the best answer](/posts/my-paths-forward-policy) to [our biggest problem](/posts/human-resource-problem).

When we are monsters we do not want to change our monster ways.  We can gauge a person's progress in their spiritual war based on the difficulty in establishing a connection with the person.

## Attention Funneling

Defense against the monster within others.

We should not give our attention away too easily or else zombies and vampires might do us harm.  The vampires at Twitter and Facebook facilitate viral spreading of content with their user interface.  A monster on the internet can spread dis-ease too easily.  Provide a path for people to gain your attention and make that path increasingly difficult based upon your popularity.  But no matter how difficult it is for someone to gain your attention, be transparent about your [path forward policy](/posts/my-paths-forward-policy).

## Engagement Process

People should be able to get our attention.  And when people get our attention we should have a process in place for engaging with others.  Our process as a low status person should be that we try to never ignore the other person and we provide enough information to the other person that we let them know that they were not ignored.  We can always honestly say something like "I appreciate your feedback".

## Ignorance Policy

When we act like monsters we will ignore people unless they can help with our cravings.  The monster will not tell you when you are being ignored or why you are being ignored or how you might stop being ignored in the future.

We should be willing to tell people when we ignore them and why we are ignoring them and how they might stop being ignored in the future.  If we are popular we must be aware of the choices our handlers are making regarding choices about who is being ignored and why they are being ignored and how that person might stop being ignored in the future.

## Meta Topic

When we are zombies we are unwilling to even consider sacrificing our views.  When we are vampires we are feeding on other people's attention.  Our actions speak louder than words.  And we learn to identify the monster patterns in others by identifying the monster patterns in ourselves.

When people are focused on a specific topic which has a low probability of consensus we should attempt to switch focus to these meta topics about the proper way of being in general and how to become a better person.

## Conclusion

[Contact us](/contact) if you want to cooperate.  If you think we are wrong then get involved.  We appreciate your cooperation in our error correction process.

### Governor of Alabama

I hope to be Governor of Alabama by 2040.
