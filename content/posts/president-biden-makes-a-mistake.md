# Executive Order on Requiring Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccination for Federal Employees

A link to the [executive order on whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/09/09/executive-order-on-requiring-coronavirus-disease-2019-vaccination-for-federal-employees/) and a link to a [copy in my repository](https://github.com/heroLFG/hugo-herolfg-site/commits/dev/content/posts/presidential-actions-2021-09-09.md).

## What is President Biden's Stated Primary Goal?
- halt the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

## What is President Biden's Stated Secondary Goal?
- the health and safety of the Federal workforce
- and the efficiency of the civil service

## How should these goals be accomplished?
- require COVID-19 vaccination for all Federal employees, subject to such exceptions as required by law
    - the CDC has found that the best way to do so is to be vaccinated

### Thoughts from Gavin Palmer

Thinking about good solutions to problems could be helpful in the event that we face a similar but more serious problem in the future.

- The claim is that the CDC says it is best to get everyone vaccinated.
    - The truth is that we don't know if everyone needs to be vaccinated.
        - We currently don't know if people who were previously infected need to be vaccinated.
        - Be sure to identify and promote people who deserve our attention.
            - We get in trouble when we place trust in people who do not deserve our trust.
                - President Biden is trusting the wrong people.

- If the goal is to halt the spread:
    - Facilitate and encourage antibody testing to allow people to know if they have had COVID-19 previously.
        - If you have had COVID-19 previously then you may not need a vaccine.
    - Allow people to become infected with the real virus at controlled times and locations.
        - Some people may choose this path over the gene therapy path.
        - Some people may be too young for the gene therapy path.
    - Faciliate and encourage remote work.
        - If I were a representative, I would be very vocal about my preference for virtual meetings.
            In President Biden's announcement about the executive order, he is not wearing a mask and he is not doing a virtual meeting.
    - Segregation on government property based on antibody tests.
        - For those Federal jobs that can't be done remotely, segregate the population based on antibody test results.
            - Publicy funded schools could try this.
    - Facilitate intentional communities within our country.
        - Make it easy for like-minded people to find each other and build their own communities with laws they find acceptable.
            - Do not be too quick to dictate laws to these intentional communities.
        - Encourage segregation of communities based on their unique risk tolerence and preference for various rules.
            - Some communities can be very libertarian, totalitarian, or something else.
