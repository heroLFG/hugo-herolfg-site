# September 2023 Resume

## Disclaimer

I was made with a large dose of "naivety", "pride", "arrogance", "selfishness", "impulsiveness", and "fear of rejection".  I'm 38 years old and I only began to learn to acknowledge these things about myself in June of this year.  I can be a little slow to learn.  I trust that each of our weaknesses comes with a corresponding strength.  And as I practice being more aware of my weaknesses, I am better able to do God's will.  That's right, I give all credit to God who works through creation.  It may appear that some person should be given credit, but that initial impression is based on a superficial oversimplification of the situation.  Each person was raised, trained, and conditioned by other people and their environment which was not of their choosing.  Our agency and free will is limited.

You might wonder why I would mention my weaknesses up front.  And that's because I'm interested in reducing corruption in ourselves and our groups.  This requires that we be honest with ourselves about our weaknesses and strengths.  Ideally, people would know their goals, roles, responsibilities, weaknesses, strengths, and sins.  I use this word "sin" and it could be translated into "missing the mark", "mistakes", or "errors" in reference to some goal.

## Goals

My goals are to love God, people, life, and creation: in that order.  I want to use what God has given to me to collaborate with others who also want to love God, people, life, and creation.  How do we do that?

### Non Violent Communication (NVC)

People cooperating together lovingly should avoid violence by using ideal forms of communication.  One way of communicating has been called Non Violent Communication (NVC).  Punching people in the face is a way of communicating, but it is violent.  Using words is less violent than punches in the face.  And there are some words and arrangements of words which are less violent than other words and arrangements of words.

One recommended way of sharing words is that a person shares their observations, feelings, values, and requests.  Our ability to communicate effectively and understand the other person depends on our ability to love the other person: aiming to understand their perspective.  It takes much effort and practice to love a person enough to understand their perspective.

###  Mind Reading Instrument (MRI)

One problem with NVC, is that most people are dishonest.  MRI can help with the problem of people being dishonest.

In Matthew 15:11, Jesus taught that what comes out of our mouths corrupts and comes from the heart (Matthew 15:18).  Jesus taught this before the creation of technology which amplifies that which comes from our mouths.  So in order to reduce corruption in modern times, we should attempt to amplify the voices and actions of the least corrupt people.  MRI can help.

Think about all of the powerful communications receiving attention in our world.  And think about what is in the heart of those people producing those powerful communications.  We can use MRI to find the least corrupt people and amplify their communications.

Use of MRI should be voluntary.

### Testimony

All testimony given while using MRI could be treated as more trustworthy than testimony which is given without MRI.

People testify to their past, present, and future.  People lie.  The people who are willing and able to lie and deceive have an advantage over the people who aren't willing to lie and deceive.  And those liars end up having more power and influence.

It has been said that power corrupts.  The truth is that corrupted people have an advantage over people with less corruption.

Do you trust your leaders, teachers, doctors, farmers, and engineers?  The use of NVC, MRI, and testimonies can help us identify the most trustworthy people!

### Claims of Injury

People are not being heard.  People have a valuable perspective to share, and the decision makers lack care for the people.  When we make use of NVC, MRI, and testimony we will begin to organize in ways such that the decision makers are better connected to the people.  The people are like a body.  And the decision makers are like the head of that body.  A head disconnected from the body is an indicator of corruption.

And so we will build communication platforms and procedures which will facilitate NVC, MRI, and testimonials at scale so that we may continually be baptized by the holy spirit: cleansing the corruption day after day.

### Signals Processing

The head of the body needs to be connected to all of the parts of the body.  And each part of the body needs to be connected to the rest of the body.  In order to do this at scale, each person can have a digital representative to help identify signals and filter noise among the oceans of information in our world.  Each person has a unique set of goals, roles, responsibilities, weaknesses, strengths, and sins which can be embedded into their digital representations.

## Roles

I practice being a son of God.  I believe Jesus was a human who became so close to God that God claimed him as a beloved son.  I think we should all aim to get closer to God such that we might also be claimed as God's beloved.  Sin causes us to be further from God.  Repenting to change our mind and behavior helps us move closer to God.

I practice being a husband.

I practice being a father.

I practice being a friend.

I practice being a reliability engineer.

## Responsibilities

## Weaknesses

### Capacity for Care

I believe my biggest weaknesses are related to my mom's death before I turned three years old.  I became someone who did not care for my own feelings and believed that people aught not be controlled by their feelings.  And so I was a person who ignored the feelings of everyone: including myself.  This led to my being a limited listener and communicator.  I did was severely limited at loving myself and others: including God.

I acknowledged that I was a bad communicator.  But I didn't know why until June of this year.  I was a bad communicator because I didn't really care about people.  Imagine that.  How is a communicator supposed to connect with an audience if the communicator doesn't actually care for the audience?  I can tell you that it's not easy.

All of those weaknesses that I mentioned in the disclaimer are a result of my lack of love.  It wasn't until I practiced loving my inner child that I began to weep for that little boy for the first time that I can recall.  And then I was able to see the source of my weaknesses.  That little boy had to deal with a difficult situation and did what he could to manage that difficult situation.  That little boy's mind adapted to the situation to protect him.

Now I've only been practicing being loving towards myself, others, and God for a few months.  And my eyes have been opened to a new world with new possibilities.

### Communication Slowness

Because of my lack of practice at caring about people and being able to understand them, my people skills are underdeveloped.  I might fail to say what I should say within a timely manner.  Or if I am pushed to say something, I might speak inappropriately.  I see this as my biggest weakness.

I'm also dealing with a lifetime of having said the wrong thing many times which has caused me to have social anxiety and fear of rejection.  Something within me craves attention: probably related to my mother's death.  And yet I failed to interact appropriately at times because I just didn't proactively care about people's feelings.  When I was rejected, I cared about feelings in a reactive way.

## Strengths

My biggest strength is my ability to see through chaos.  God has given me the ability to remain calm and identify signals.  I think this is in part because of my previously conditioned lack of care for people (including myself) and feelings.  I wasn't shaped by the culture as much as all the people who were conditioned to care for people's feelings.  In fact, I tended to look down upon all the people and their irrational feelings and tendencies to obey authority.  I looked down upon people's tendency towards cultural norms.

The words "orthodox" and "idiomatic" come to mind.  Many people learn orthodox idioms which work in a world where people agree to do the orthodox and idiomatic way.  But those people aren't prepared to handle chaos.  God has prepared me to handle chaos.

## Sins

### Major Sin

The four laws are like:
1. don't murder
2. don't steal
3. don't do sexual immorality
4. don't mistreat animals

I avoid these with my actions.  I avoid these in my mind.  I want to avoid these through my indirect actions.  That's why I am writing this resume.

### Minor Sin

We can "miss the mark" in many ways beyond the major sins.  For example, we might make a commitment and then fail to do what is expected.  This is a minor sin.  I guess we have all done this.  I know I have.  But it's still a minor sin that we can attempt to get better at.  We can attempt to reduce the corruption by reducing our sins.

The reason we do all minor sins is because we are doing idolatry.  We forget about God.  It's easy to do.  We have all done it even after we commit to do God's will.  How are we supposed to do God's will if we forget to listen to God?  We can't!  And so the path towards living without sin is the path by which we learn to avoid idolatry: listening to God at each and every moment.
