# Introduction
 
I remember being a child and having a girl tell me she knew who Santa Claus was but she wasn't supposed to tell me.  I begged her until she finally told me everyone's parents are pretending to be Santa Claus.  She was a Jehovah's Witness.
 
I couldn't believe everyone was participating in a grand conspiracy, but I also had to begin my journey as a practicing skeptic and investigator.  I remember when all the pieces came together.  I called out my family member on their mistake.  I was proud to have figured it out.  But I was also disappointed that I had been lied to.
 
## Conclusion
 
All I need is a good reason.  I hadn't found a good reason for doing this Santa Claus thing until this morning.  My idea is that we should enjoy giving good gifts to people without a care for receiving acknowledgement.  I also don't like telling lies.  So I am thinking about giving gifts from "Santa Impersonator".
 
It would be nice if we could scale up a Santa Impersonator operation which connected people who want to give with people who have unmet wants and needs.

God bless Jehovah's Witnesses!
