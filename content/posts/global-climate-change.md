The [Convective Heat Engine (CHE)](https://convective-heat-engine.github.io/) is the primary infrastructure for a sustainable city design which can be used to capture thousands of tons of carbon per year while providing a reliable supply of water, shelter, and electricity for a population of 100,000 people.

The latest estimated price of a CHE is $6 billion.  The price tag per ton of carbon being sequestered looks expensive at first glance.  But the CHE is first and foremost a new infrastructure technology for sustainable city designs.  The net negative carbon emissions is merely a biproduct.

When we properly view the CHE as infrastucture we can begin to see that a population of 100,000 people could invest $60,000 into a sustainable and reliable home.
