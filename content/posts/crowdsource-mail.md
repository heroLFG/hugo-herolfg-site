After many years of trying to find a group to help, I was introduced to [Jacob Faturechi](https://www.youtube.com/c/faturechi) who shared an experimental idea to fix distributed cognition (or cognitive outsourcing).  We call it [crowdsource mail](https://github.com/heroLFG/crowdsourcemail).

This could be code named "Project Jethro".

## Exodus 18

Moses' father-in-law is named Jethro

> Moses immediately listened to his father-in-law and did all that he had said. Moses chose capable men out of all Israel and appointed them heads over the people, as chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens. So they judged the people when cases arose. A difficult case they would bring to Moses, but every minor case they would judge.
